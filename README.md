## 🚨 The Problem

India's real estate market — worth **$650 billion** — operates with a dangerous lack of transparency. Homebuyers making **multi-crore decisions** face two compounding problems:

### Problem 1 — Misleading Commute Times `[Pain Score: 85.5/100]`
> *"Real estate marketing claims like '5 minutes from metro' are wildly inaccurate because they measure straight-line distances on maps rather than actual peak-hour walking time accounting for traffic signals, crowded sidewalks, and infrastructure obstacles."*

- Developers advertise straight-line map distances, not actual travel time
- Peak-hour reality is 3–4x longer than advertised
- No standardised commute disclosure requirement in India
- Buyers discover the truth only after possession

### Problem 2 — No Standardised Neighbourhood Data `[Pain Score: 94.5/100]`
> *"Home buyers making multi-crore investment decisions lack comprehensive, data-driven information about neighbourhood characteristics like school quality, crime statistics, air quality indices, water availability, power outage frequency, and future infrastructure plans."*

- No single source for locality intelligence in India
- Government data is siloed across multiple portals
- Buyers rely on broker-provided information (conflict of interest)
- NRIs have zero ability to remotely assess property context

---

## 💡 The Solution

**PropSight 360** is a forensic real estate intelligence platform that aggregates, cross-verifies, and presents property data in a transparent, data-driven interface — empowering buyers to make decisions with complete neighbourhood and commute intelligence.

```
When a user opens PropSight 360, they should feel:
"I have POWER. I cannot be fooled.
 I know more than the brokers. I am protected."
```
